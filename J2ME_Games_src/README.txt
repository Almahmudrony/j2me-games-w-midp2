To build with KToolbar: 
copy each chapter's directory tree into the apps directory under the 
WTK2.0 directory.  For example, after copying you should have the 
following directory:
WTK2.0/apps/ch01/src/net/frog_parrot/hello/Hello.java
or
WTK2.0\apps\ch01\src\net\frog_parrot\hello\Hello.java

After copying, the chapters can be opened as projects in KToolbar.



To build from the command line: (Linux/Unix)
under each chapter directory (ch01, etc.) is the corresponding bin 
directory which contains the build script called build.sh.  The paths 
in the build.sh script need to be updated.  The corresponding jar and 
jad files are created in the build directory.
